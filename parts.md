  [Plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-High-Quality-Anodized-Aluminum-Positioning-Board-Plate-For-GH60-PCB-60-Keyboard-DIY/32562370416.html) This is the only plate they carry that does just about every layout. The other plates do not do HHKB layout.

  [LEDs](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-DIY-50-pcs-lot-LED-Bulb-Beads-Different-Colors-For-Mechanical-Keyboard/32517784269.html) lots of 5, get 13 lots, ice-blue are bright.

  [Keycaps](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-HHKB-Top-printed-Cherry-Profile-HHKB-Keysel-For-HHKB-MX-Switches-Mechanical-Keyboard/32801406176.html) HHKB keycaps are hard to find at a reasonable price. Leave a message asking for 2 extra keys, bottem row corner 1.5u.

  [Stabilizers - Kit 2 - 7u + 4x2u](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Cherry-Style-OEM-Clear-PCB-mounted-PCB-Stabilizers-Satellite-Axis-7u-6-25u-2u-For-MX/32719735398.html) 'Kit 2' has 1-7u and 4-2u. HHKB only needs 1-7u and 2-2u.

  [Cases](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/Case-Plate-PCB/429151_511791249.html) GH60 compatible work.

  [sip sockets for leds](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Wholesales-DIY-200-pcs-lot-240pcs-lot-Crystal-Base-Long-Pin-Hot-Plug-Hot-Swap-For/429151_32622320922.html) I did this on one keyboard. You have to take apart every switch and drop 2 of these in, so 130 for 65 switches. If you do this then you might as well lube the switches, and while you are  lubing do the stabilizers too.
